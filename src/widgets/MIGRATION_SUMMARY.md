# Widgets Layer Migration Summary

## Overview
The widgets layer has been successfully migrated to follow Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) principles. All widgets now expose only React components through `index.ts` files and contain no direct business logic.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Business Logic Extraction
- **Activities**: Extracted filtering and sorting logic from `ActivitiesGrid` into separate feature hooks:
  - `useActivitiesFilter` - Handles activity filtering by type, priority, status, and search
  - `useActivitiesSort` - Handles activity sorting by priority, due date, and creation date
  
- **Reports**: Extracted report management logic into feature hooks:
  - `useReports` - Provides access to reports and templates with CRUD operations
  - `useReport` - Manages individual report and template data
  - `useReportFormatting` - Handles value formatting and category styling

### 2. New Feature Hooks Created
- `src/features/activities/hooks/use-activities-filter.ts`
- `src/features/activities/hooks/use-activities-sort.ts`
- `src/features/reports/hooks/use-reports.ts`
- `src/features/activities/index.ts`
- `src/features/reports/index.ts`

### 3. Widget Composition Improvements
- **StatsCardGrid**: Created new composite widget that combines multiple `StatsCard` components
- **HeroSection**: Already well-structured as a composite widget
- **PropertiesGrid**: Already properly structured using context providers

### 4. Updated Widget Components
- `ActivitiesGrid`: Now uses extracted feature hooks instead of inline business logic
- `ReportViewer`: Updated to use `useReport` and `useReportFormatting` hooks
- `ReportCard`: Updated to use `useReports` and `useReportFormatting` hooks
- `ReportBuilder`: Updated to use `useReports` hook for template management
- `StatsCard`: Enhanced to accept styling props for better composition

## Compliance with FSD Principles

### ✅ What Widgets Now Contain:
- **UI Composition**: Combining multiple features and entities into cohesive blocks
- **Presentation Logic**: Responsive behavior, animations, layout management
- **Event Handling**: User interaction handlers that delegate to features
- **Component Orchestration**: Managing multiple UI components working together

### ✅ What Widgets No Longer Contain:
- **Business Logic**: Moved to features layer
- **Data Manipulation**: Filtering, sorting, formatting moved to features
- **API Calls**: Already handled by features/shared layers
- **State Management**: Using context providers and feature hooks

### ✅ Clean Dependencies:
- **Can import from**: `features`, `entities`, `shared`
- **Cannot import from**: `app`, `processes`, `pages`
- **No direct store access**: All data access through feature hooks

## Examples of Proper Widget Usage

### StatsCardGrid Widget
```typescript
import { StatsCardGrid } from '@/widgets/dashboard';

// Usage in pages
<StatsCardGrid 
  stats={[
    { title: "Properties", value: 1234, icon: HomeIcon, trend: "up" },
    { title: "Sales", value: 567, icon: DollarIcon, trend: "up" }
  ]} 
/>
```

### ActivitiesGrid Widget
```typescript
import { ActivitiesGrid } from '@/widgets/activities';

// Usage in pages - business logic handled by features
<ActivitiesGrid 
  activities={activities}
  searchQuery={searchQuery}
  filters={filters}
/>
```

## Migration Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI composition separated from business logic
2. **Reusability**: Widgets can be easily composed in different contexts
3. **Testability**: Business logic in features is easier to test
4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between presentation and business logic
5. **FSD Compliance**: Proper layer dependencies and responsibilities

## Next Steps
- All widgets are now properly structured and compliant with FSD
- Business logic has been extracted to appropriate features
- Widgets expose only React components through index.ts files
- No direct business logic remains in widget components
