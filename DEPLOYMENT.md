## üìã One-Week Monitoring Checklist

### Daily Tasks
- [ ] Check container health status
- [ ] Review application logs for errors
- [ ] Verify both URLs are accessible
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Check Nginx access logs

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review aggregated logs
- [ ] Check for security issues
- [ ] Verify performance metrics
- [ ] Test failover between ports
- [ ] Document any issues found

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Response Time:** < 2 seconds for main pages
- **Error Rate:** < 1% of requests
- **Uptime:** > 99.9%
- **Memory Usage:** < 512MB per container
- **CPU Usage:** < 50% average

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container Won't Start:**
```bash
docker logs cozymls-app-staging
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

**Port Already in Use:**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :3007
netstat -ano | findstr :8007

# Stop conflicting services
docker-compose down
```

**Application Not Loading:**
- Check if containers are running: `docker ps`
- Check health endpoints: `curl http://localhost:3007/health`
- Review nginx logs: `docker logs cozymls-app-staging`

## üéØ Success Criteria for Phase 1

- [x] Application successfully deployed to staging
- [x] Both port 3007 and 8007 accessible
